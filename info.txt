== TODO
= configurable fractal formulas
	= parser would be cool
		= maybe a way to compile to c# code on the fly
		= or a domain specific language (DSL)
= rotations about an axis
	= not sure how to do this yet
	= [Zr,Zi,Cr,Ci]
= implement image per orbit
	include all samples in each image
	add option to limit total images
		limit by number of points before escape
		limit by bounds
= progress indicator
= clean up temp files when program is forcibly closed
	= why doesn't 'using' do this ?
= add option to limit parallelism
= unit tests
= make a readme

== Interesting
= take a look at some of the speedups mentioned here https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/buddhabrot-fractals/
