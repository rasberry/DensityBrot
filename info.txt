== TODO
= multithreaded calculation
	= TODO put multithreaded commits into their own branch
	= it seem like pebble lock makes the calcs slower than just doing a single thread
	= so need to either find a method that does not need data sharing
		- could create a matrix per thread then merge
	=  or just stick with a single thread
= configurable fractal formulas
	= parser would be cool
		= maybe a way to compile to c# code on the fly
		= or a domain specific language (DSL)
= rotations about an axis
	= not sure how to do this yet
	= [Zr,Zi,Cr,Ci]
= implement image per orbit
	include all samples in each image
	add option to limit total images
		limit by number of points before escape
		limit by bounds
= progress indicator
= clean up temp files when program is forcibly closed
	= why doesn't 'using' do this ?
= add option to limit parallelism
= unit tests
= make a readme

== Intersting
= take a look at some of the speedups mentioned here https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/buddhabrot-fractals/
