== TODO
= configurable fractal formulas
	= parser would be cool
		= maybe a way to compile to c# code on the fly
		= or a domain specific language (DSL)
= rotations about an axis
	= not sure how to do this yet
	= [Zr,Zi,Cr,Ci]
= implement image per orbit
	include all samples in each image
	add option to limit total images
		limit by number of points before escape
		limit by bounds
		image by orbit orginal (1 iter, 2 iter, etc...)
= unit tests
= implement speedups mentioned here https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/buddhabrot-fractals/
= add option to use image range as bailout (so square instead of round)
= make a readme
= figure out why images are still coming out grayish for higher samples per point values
